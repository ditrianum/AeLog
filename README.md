# AeLog
atmospheric electricity logger

AeLog is an atmospheric electricity logger that logs the voltage levels recorded by a specific device that is usually equiped with an OpAmp like the TL081. The recorded values are time stamped and saved to a CSV file. AeView uses this file to display the values in a graph.

The source code was developed and compiled with Lazarus 2.0.2 and 2.0.4 on Linux.
